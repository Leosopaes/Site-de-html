    <p> Welcome to Uncanny Web, a space dedicated to exploring the evolution of modern horror and what makes it so impactful today. Unlike the classic scares of old, contemporary horror dives deeper into psychological terror, social anxieties, and unsettling realism.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This site breaks down how recent horror films, series, and literature have shifted from simple jump scares to stories that mess with our minds, question reality, and confront real-world fears like isolation, identity, and the unknown lurking within society.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>You'll discover explanations of current trends such as slow-burn suspense, body horror, and the uncanny valley, and how creators use these to disturb and provoke thought rather than just frighten.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Uncanny Web invites you to understand why modern horror isn’t just about fear — it’s a mirror reflecting the darker sides of our contemporary world.</p>

        <li>Analog Horror:</li>
        <p>Analog Horror is a subgenre of horror that uses the aesthetic and style of old technology, like VHS tapes, 80s/90s television broadcasts, home recordings, or security footage. It presents itself as "lost," "found," or "forbidden" media, which makes it feel more mysterious and unsettling.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Key">Key Features:</li>
            <li class="analog">Low-quality visuals (grainy video, static, glitches)</li>
            <li class="analog">On-screen text (warnings, subtitles, strange messages)</li>
            <li class="analog">Distorted audio or eerie silence</li>
            <li class="analog">A strong sense of “something is wrong”, but not fully explained</li>
            <li class="analog">Feels real, but is fictional — like you’re watching something you weren’t meant to find</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li class="Key">Popular Examples:</li>
            <li class="analog">The Mandela Catalogue</li>
            <li class="analog">Local 58</li>
            <li class="analog">Gemini home intertainement</li>
            <li class="analog">The Walten Files</li>

        <br>
        <li>Uncanny Valley</li>
        <p>Uncanny Valley is a term used to describe the discomfort we feel when something looks almost human... but not quite. This can happen with robots, dolls, animations, or hyper-realistic digital faces — when they’re very close to looking real, but something about them feels “off” or strange.</p>
        <p>Why is it scary?Our brains recognize that it should look human, but small details (blank eyes, unnatural movements, artificial skin) break the illusion  and that causes a feeling of fear or unease.It's like the body is saying:“This looks human… but something is wrong. Be alert.”</p>
        <p>Uncanny Valley is widely used in horror films and games to create creepy characters without needing monsters. The fear comes from something that is almost normal, but deeply wrong.</p>
        <ul>
             <li class="Key">Practical Examples:</li>
             <li class="analog">A doll with very realistic eyes but no facial expression</li>
             <li class="analog">A face generated by AI that blinks strangely</li>
             <li class="analog">A robot that moves in a stiff or unnatural way</li>
