        <h2>Welcome to the Echoes from the Screen:</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Step into a flickering world where static whispers louder than silence, and forgotten footage refuses to stay buried. In this corner of our site, we delve into the eerie grain of forgotten tapes, the ominous tone of old broadcasts, and the uneasy feeling that something is watching... just off frame.
         <br> 
         <br>
         These fragments were never meant to be seen again—yet here they are, preserved, decoded, and revisited.
         <br>
         <br>
         Proceed carefully. Some signals should have stayed lost.
         <br>
         <br>
         Not everything recorded was meant to last—but some traces refuse to fade. In this section, we explore signals that pulse like a heartbeat beneath layers of time, stories too fractured to be whole, too real to be forgotten.
         <br>
         <br>
         You'll find moments where clarity shimmers just beyond reach. Glitches become voices. Patterns emerge from noise. Familiar shapes distort as if the past is trying to speak—but not in words.
         <br>
         <br>
         Here, timelines blur. Technology feels haunted. And every frame invites a question no one is ready to answer.
